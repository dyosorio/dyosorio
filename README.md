## Hi, there! I'm Danny 👋🏻

### I'm a Backend Developer 👩🏻‍💻

🏗️ I'm a Developer and I enjoy creating side projects that simplify my life.  
💻 I originally graduated as an Architect, but I've been working as a Developer for about 4 years.  
🧶 I enjoy long walks while listening to podcasts, building with lego, knitting, reading and espending time with my family.

My preferred tech stack includes 
- JavaScript,
- Node.js,
- Microservices,
- PostgreSQL
- GraphQL,
- NestJS,
- Kafka,
- Docker,
- Salesforce Commerce Cloud for e-commerce projects
