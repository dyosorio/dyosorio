## Hi, there! I'm Danny 👋

### I'm a Backend Developer 👩‍💻

- I like developing side projects that I can use to make my life easier. 
- I'm a graduated Architect but I've working as a Developer for about 4 years.
- I enjoy talking long walks while listening to podcasts, tracking my energy consumption, track expenses, grocery list status and automating repetitive tasks!
