## Hi, there! I'm Danny 👋

### I'm a Backend Developer 👩‍💻

I'm a Backend Developer and I enjoy creating side projects that simplify my life.  
I originally graduated as an Architect, but I've been working as a Developer for about 4 years.  
I enjoy long walks while listening to podcasts, building Node projects, tracking my energy consumption, managing expenses, organizing grocery lists, and automating boring repetitive tasks.

My preferred tech stack includes 
- JavaScript,
- Node.js,
- Microservices,
- GraphQL,
- Salesforce Commerce Cloud for e-commerce projects
